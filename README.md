揭发以点付大头张银海为首的团伙虚拟货币发行诈骗的行为。

点付大头，原名张银海，涉嫌发行闪电比特币LBTC和发行DAF进行融资诈骗。

2017年末，张银海利用比特币分叉作为噱头，分叉出闪电比特币（LBTC）。最初私募采用1个比特币换取100个LBTC，后在zb交易所进行拉盘，强行改为1个比特币换80个LBTC，至今还没有发完。私募共诈骗60余人。按当时私募价格LBTC价值1000元左右，现在50元左右。私募被诈骗之人组织在“闪电信仰群”微信群中。

闪电比特币最高时拉盘到10000人民币，现在价格是50元人民币，相比最高点跌了99%。期间，张银海通过“闪电比特币才是真的比特币”、“再也见不到三位数的闪电比特币”、“中本聪的白皮书就是闪电比特币的白皮书”、“两年后市值前五”等行为喊单拉盘割韭菜。

闪电比特币涉及虚假宣传。宣称闪电比特币没有预挖，但实际上预挖了比特币上不活跃地址的币，通过这一手段，张银海共私自获取了约270万的闪电比特币。

宣称闪电比特币上线bitfinex交易所，但实际上至今没有实现。

宣称和日本的房产中介签订了合作，但此日本房产中介只有一个简单的网页( http://silkroadpartners.jp/ )，除此之外查不到任何信息。

宣称预挖的lbtc由海外基金会决策使用，但实际上未见任何此基金会的信息披露。

私募之前宣称技术人员有Lisk和NXT社区的技术大牛，甚至有比特币core团队技术人员，但真实情况是，开发人员github主页代码不活跃，代码开发缓慢，一两个月只增加了173行代码，多数尽是打印等无实际作用的代码。

项目进展延期不通报，闪电锁仓延迟不通报。被闪电投资者通过看代码在群里爆出来后，才借口其他原因补救。

2017年10月份左右，借着ICO的势头融资诈骗，发行DAF代币，采用250万个DAF代币换取150个以太坊ETH的比例非法融资。宣称三个月后即可在交易所进行流通，实际情况是，截止到目前，没有任何项目进展。投资者如果问到进展情况，只以“在做合规”打发搪塞。

近日，张银海在lbtc暴跌和daf毫无进展的同时，开办GJ数字货币交易所，gj.com，不知是否是新一轮的割韭菜行为。

Here explains the issue of fraudulent scams about the ICO(initial coin offering) headed by Zhang Yinhai.

Zhang Yinhai, suspected of financial fraud for lightning bitcoin(LBTC) and DAF.

At the end of 2017, Zhang Yinhai used bitcoin forks as a gimmick to fork out lightning bitcoin. Initially, private placement was one bitcoin in exchange for one hundred LBTCs, and then forcibly changed to one bitcoin for eighty LBTCs after pulling up the price on the zb exchange deliberately. Until now, only sixty lbtcs are given. Private placement cheated more than sixty people. According to the private placement price at that time, LBTC values about one thousand Chinese Yuan, and now it is about fifty Chinese Yuan. These deceived people are organized in the wechat group of so-called "Lightning Faith Group".

Lightning Bitcoin was pulled up to 10,000 Chinese Yuan at the highest level, and now the price is 50 Chinese Yuan, which is 99% lower than the highest point. During this period, Zhang Yinhai boasted "Lightning Bitcoin is the real bitcoin", "Lightning bitcoin less than 100 Chinese Yuan will not seen any longer", "Satoshi's white paper is the white paper of Lightning Bitcoin", "The market value of LBTC will be in top 5 in two years". By this way, Zhang Yinhai cheated a lot of people.

Lightning Bitcoin is claimed to be no pre-mining, but actually Zhang Yinhai pre-mined the bitcoin of the inactive address. Through this way, Zhang Yinhai has selfishly acquired about 2.7 million lightning bitcoins.

Lightning bitcoin was claimed to be on the Bitfinex exchange soon, but this is not been implemented so far.

Lightning bitcoin is claimed to have signed a cooperation with a Japanese real estate agency. But we can only find one simple webpage ( http://silkroadpartners.jp/ ) about this Japanese real estate agency, nothing else could be found.

The pre-mined lbtc was declared to be managed by overseas foundation, but in fact nothing can be found about this overseas foundation.

Before the private placement, Zhang Yinhai boasted the technology team would include technical talents in the Lisk and NXT communities, and even the Bitcoin core members. However, in fact the developers are not active on the github. The code development progress is slow, only about 173 lines are added in about one month. Most of these codes have no practical effect, such as printing.

The progress of this project is always delayed, and at the same time the investors are not informed. Take the LBTC node election for example, this delay event was exposed by code check by investors.

Around October 2017, along with the prevalence of ICO fraud, Zhang Yinhai issued DAF tokens for illegal financing, and adopted the ration of 150 Ethereums in exchange for 2.5 million DAF tokens. Zhang Yinhai claimed that DAF would be circulated on the exchange after three months. In face, as of now, there is not any project progress. If investors ask about the progress, Zhang Yinhai always send them back by saying "doing compliance now". But we can't know any detail information about daf compliance.

While the lbtc price plummets and daf does not have any progress, Zhang Yinhai opened the GJ digital currency exchange( gj.com ) recently. I wonder whether it is a new round of fraud.
